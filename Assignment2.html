	<b id="b1"><u>The merits of social media</u></b><br>
		

    <b style="color:blue;">1.It has stayed true to its name is  social media</b><br>
     Human beings are social creatures. Irrespective of the physical boundaries or uncoverable distances, our species have always found a way to interact with each other. When social media brought us closer, simplified communication and eradicated the international boundaries, we naturally did not hesitate to give it a place in our lives. Social media has spread connectivity. We can constantly stay in touch, no matter our location, and effectively feed our social needs. No other way of interaction can come near to the benefits of social media on this ground.<br>
            
    <b style="color:blue;">2.More freedom to express</b><br>

    Governments have been formed and toppled with the power of social media. Social issues come to the forefront more easily. No expression, no thought, goes unnoticed anymore and every individual now has the option to voice their opinion. Social media has successfully removed autocracy at every level and people have the power to make a change. Be it businesses or politicians, every figure of power now has to stay on guard as the so-called netizens have a new found freedom of expression.<br>
             
    <b style="color: blue;">3. Educational breach till the grassroots</b><br>

    The impact of social media is probably more profound in developing countries where the society struggles to spread literacy. With social media and its ease of access, that bottleneck has been finally cleared. Where there is no provision of books, the internet does the job and it is through social media that people can connect and spread knowledge. Video streaming and sharing have increased. Local languages are garnering popularity. The entire standard of the society has gradually increased in the past few years, all due to social media
             
             <br>

    <b style="color: blue;">4. Small businesses have a marketing platform:</b><br>

    how does this impact the society? Economy. Previously, all the advertising prowess rested with big brands with huge bank balances. Then, social media became widespread and free. Anyone, with a decent product, can use the outreach of social media to reach out to potential customers and make a sale, at times, trumping the products of the big companies. This has brought in more entrepreneurs in our society. The economy is flourishing. Standard of living has improved and social media has been the main curator throughout.
      <br>
    <b style="color: blue;">5. Unhindered spread of awareness:</b><br>

    No one can put a figure to the number of people who have quit smoking after watching a post on social media. Or a driver who has vowed to drive safely after coming across an awareness campaign. Be it women empowerment or relief requests, the worldwide pride movement or environmental issues, social media is the platform to spread awareness and this trend continues to rise. People are more informed now. No one has to work hard to know something. Social media has made our lives better and improved the society as a whole.

	<p id="p3"><b id="b2"><u>The demerits of social media</u></b><br>
    <b style="color: magenta;">1. Happiness index is at an all-time low</b>

    In fact, there is a term to describe this situation – social media induced depression. The platforms have been constantly causing a huge gap in our expectations. A morphed photograph or a momentary happy phase in someone’s life causes us to imagine a reality that does not exist. And when we go out there and face life, the expectational gap rises our levels of unhappiness. We want to live someone else’s life, follow an overhyped profession or lifestyle. All the while, we ignore our own reality and stay unhappy throughout.
     <br>
     <b style="color: magenta;">2. Fake news spread like wildfire</b>

      The ease of sharing has boosted literacy, but it has also brought in the menace of fake news. People easily receive what is untrue, share it out of their developed habit, and lead to consequences that are truly unacceptable. Cases of mob lynching happen every day. Communal intolerance is also at its triggering point. Social media are also platforms where fake information spread like wildfire and poison our society. The sheer expanse of the social platforms makes it harder to monitor every activity and this devil continues to live among us.
     <br>
     <b style="color: magenta;">3. Cyberbullying and trolling</b>

     Children and teenagers have taken their own lives after becoming victims of cyberbullying. Celebrities are constant targets of trolling which obviously make their lives miserable. Social media, along with outreach and connectivity, has also instigated our animal instinct of dominance over each other and the rate of these societal hazards has increased at an alarming rate. Fake accounts make easy victims out of children online. The craze for virality keeps trolling unchecked. The entire society is suffering with no one being spared.<br>

     <b style="color: magenta;">4. Privacy is no longer a word</b>

    Unfortunately, everything that we put up on the internet is never private, no matter what the social media platforms claim. It only takes an expert’s hand to hack into our accounts and extract everything about us. Information is the new currency and all our data are sold in the market. Based on our info, we are shown ads, businesses flourish, and the reality remains hidden. To understand this, just look back in history has to how many times have Facebook been hacked? The answers lie right there.<br>
