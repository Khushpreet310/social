     Human beings are social creatures. Irrespective of the physical boundaries or uncoverable distances, our species have always found a way to interact with each other. When social media brought us closer, simplified communication and eradicated the international boundaries, we naturally did not hesitate to give it a place in our lives. Social media has spread connectivity. We can constantly stay in touch, no matter our location, and effectively feed our social needs. No other way of interaction can come near to the benefits of social media on this ground.<br>

    	<span id="b3"><u>The demerits of social media</u></span><br>
    <b id="b5">1. Happiness index is at an all-time low:</b>

    In fact, there is a term to describe this situation – social media induced depression. The platforms have been constantly causing a huge gap in our expectations. A morphed photograph or a momentary happy phase in someone’s life causes us to imagine a reality that does not exist. And when we go out there and face life, the expectational gap rises our levels of unhappiness. We want to live someone else’s life, follow an overhyped profession or lifestyle. All the while, we ignore our own reality and stay unhappy throughout.
     <br>
     <b id="b5">2. Fake news spread like wildfire:</b>

      The ease of sharing has boosted literacy, but it has also brought in the menace of fake news. People easily receive what is untrue, share it out of their developed habit, and lead to consequences that are truly unacceptable. Cases of mob lynching happen every day. Communal intolerance is also at its triggering point. Social media are also platforms where fake information spread like wildfire and poison our society. The sheer expanse of the social platforms makes it harder to monitor every activity and this devil continues to live among us.
